# Dev server configuration variables for tv_frontend (Vite 5)
# Copy this file to ".env" and adjust as needed for local development.
# In CI/containers, set these as environment variables instead of editing files.

# PORT the Vite dev server should bind to. The stable launcher and vite.config.js
# read this at startup only and enforce strictPort behavior.
PORT=3000

# HOST to allow in Vite's allowedHosts list (optional).
# If unset, defaults to standard local/container hosts: localhost, 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0
# Set this if your CI/container exposes a specific hostname that must be allowed.
# HOST=my-ci-host.internal
