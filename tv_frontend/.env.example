# Example environment variables for tv_frontend
# Copy to .env to customize. Do NOT modify .env while `npm run dev` is running,
# as changing env files can trigger restarts in other setups. This project already
# ignores .env changes during dev, but avoid touching it to reduce noise.
#
# PORT will be read by vite.config.js; defaults to 3000 if unset.
PORT=3000
