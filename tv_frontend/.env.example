# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# Dev server environment variables for tv_frontend
# Purpose: Provide explicit defaults for CI/containers to avoid passing CLI flags after `npm run dev`.
# Usage: copy to .env (optional) or set in environment. Do NOT pass flags like --port/--host after npm run dev.
#
# Host to bind. Default is 0.0.0.0 for containers.
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Port to use. Default is 3000. Vite runs with strictPort=true and will not auto-increment.
PORT=3000

# If your environment requires watch polling (e.g., restricted FS notifications), set to "true".
# VITE_WATCH_POLLING=true
