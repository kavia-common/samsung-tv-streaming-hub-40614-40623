# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# tv_frontend environment example
# Purpose:
# - Provide stable defaults for the Vite dev server in CI/containers.
# - Use these variables instead of passing CLI flags after `npm run dev`.
#
# Usage:
#   cp .env.example .env
#   (optionally edit values)
#   npm run dev            # launcher reads these at start
#
# Notes:
# - PORT/HOST are read once at startup by vite.config.js and bin/start-dev.js.
# - Do NOT pass flags after npm run dev (e.g., "--port/--host"); use env vars instead.

# Host IP to bind; launcher and vite.config use host:true, effectively 0.0.0.0.
# You may set a specific hostname to be added in allowedHosts as needed in CI.
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Fixed dev server port with strictPort: true.
# If already in use, launcher exits 0 assuming a healthy server is running.
PORT=3000

# Optional: Enable polling for file watching in constrained filesystems
# VITE_WATCH_POLLING=true
