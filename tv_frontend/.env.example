# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# Environment variables supported by tv_frontend dev server (Vite via start-dev launcher)
# Usage in CI/containers:
#   PORT=3000 HOST=0.0.0.0 npm run dev
# Notes:
# - Do NOT append vite flags after "npm run dev"; use these env vars instead.
# - The launcher binds to 0.0.0.0 and enforces strictPort. If port is already in use, it exits 0 assuming an existing healthy server.

# Host binding and allowed host header
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Dev server port; must be available. With strictPort, Vite will not change ports.
PORT=3000

# Optional: enable polling-based watcher in some CI environments (default false)
VITE_WATCH_POLLING=false
